### Formatting

Please note the following rules for formatting your code:

This project comes also with an [.editorconfig][editorconfig-docs] that should already handle most of the cases outlined

They are all expected to run without any warnings or errors, until the Pull Request will be merged. Please look into the
output of the Workflows that were executed on your Pull Request to check whether everything complies with our checks.
